            <h4>Hi There,</h4>
            <br>
            <p>We’re excited that you're sharing your work with us so we can share it with the world!</p>
            <p>Before we get started, make sure you have the following close at hand:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Your ticket site link.</b> (We don't provide ticketing services, we just help people discover your work.) </li>
                <li><b>An image for your event.</b> It's best if it is horizontal, doesn't have text on it, and has dimensions of at least 800 x 450  and is under 10mb in size.</li>
                <li><b>Text describing your event.</b> </li>
                <li>If it's an in-person event, text describing your <b>COVID-19 policies and protocols.</b> </li>
                <li><b>Your ticket price options.</b> We support multiple ticket types, including Pay What You Can, and many common currencies.</li> 
                <li>Be prepared to answer questions about <b>accessibility, content advisories, the nature of physical contact</b> at the event (if any), and the <b>nature of interaction</b> at the event.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Once you’ve entered everything, smash that “Submit” button. We’ll get back to you with questions if we need anything cleared up!</p>
            <p>Best,<br>
